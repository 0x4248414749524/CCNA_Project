Problem Statement: "Designing and Implementing a Network for a Growing Designing Company"

You have been hired as a network engineer to design and implement a network infrastructure for a small but rapidly growing designing company. The company has around 50 employees, including designers, project managers, and administrative staff. They work with large design files and require a reliable and high-performance network to support their daily operations.

Requirements:
1. Robust Network Performance: The network should provide high-speed and low-latency connectivity to ensure efficient file transfers and seamless collaboration among employees.
2. Network Redundancy: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity.
3. Secure Data Access: Set up secure access control mechanisms to protect sensitive design files from unauthorized access.
4. Segmentation: Create separate network segments (VLANs) for different departments, such as design, project management, and administration, to optimize network traffic and enhance security.
5. Wireless Network: Provide a reliable and secure Wi-Fi network to support mobile devices and allow flexibility in the workplace.
6. Remote Access: Enable secure remote access for employees who may need to work from home or while traveling.
7. Scalability: Design the network to accommodate future growth in terms of employees and network devices.
8. Network Monitoring: Implement network monitoring tools to proactively detect and address any network performance issues.

Deliverables:
1. Network Design Proposal: A detailed document outlining the proposed network topology, IP addressing scheme, VLAN setup, wireless network design, and security measures.
2. Network Implementation Report: A report summarizing the steps taken to configure and implement the network components, including routers, switches, access points, and security appliances.
3. Network Diagram: A visual representation of the network topology and device connections.
4. Security Policy: A document outlining the security policies, access control rules, and firewall configurations to protect the network from cyber threats.
5. Remote Access Setup Guide: A step-by-step guide on how to configure and use the secure remote access solution for employees.

Note: As with any network implementation, always perform thorough testing in a controlled environment before deploying the changes in the production network. This will help identify and address any potential issues proactively.
